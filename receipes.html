            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Butter Chicken, also known as murg makhani, is an Indian curry dish made of chicken thatâ€™s coated in a well seasoned tomato gravy that includes butter and cream.</li>
                </ol>
                    
                <ol>
                    <p>Chicken Marinade</p>
                    <li>Toss chicken with marinade mixture: In a large mixing bowl toss together chicken pieces, yogurt, lemon juice, 1 Tbsp garam masala, 3 tsp fenugreek leaves, the turmeric, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 Tbsp garlic, 1 Tbsp ginger and salt to taste (I use 1 tsp).</li>
                    <li>Rest in fridge: Cover bowl and transfer to refrigerator and let marinate. How long to marinate: at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>Spread chicken on 1/4 baking sheet: After marinating transfer chicken to a greased 13 by 9-inch rimmed baking sheet and spread into an even layer.</li>
                    <li>Broil chicken to cook through: Move oven rack 3 inches below broiler in oven. Preheat broiler to high heat, once heated place chicken in oven and broil until cooked through and browned, about 10 â€“ 15 minutes.</li>
                    <p>Butter Chicken Sauce</p>
                    <li>Melt butter in skillet: Meanwhile melt 4 Tbsp butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Saute vegetables: Add onion and saute until lightly golden brown about 7 minutes. Add remaining 1 Tbsp garlic and 1 Tbsp ginger and saute 1 minute longer.</li>
                    <li>Bloom spices: Stir in remaining 1 Tbsp garam masala and 1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika and 1 tsp fenugreek. Saute 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add tomatoes and simmer: Pour in tomatoes. Cover and simmer over low heat 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Puree sauce in blender: Transfer tomato mixture to a blender. Cover with lid and remove center insert from blender lid, cover with a folded kitchen towel or several paper towels. Blend sauce on low until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Return sauce to pan along with cream and broth: Return sauce to skillet over medium-low heat, scrapping any excess from blender jar into pan. Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth and stir. Season sauce with salt and pepper to taste and cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Mix chicken in with sauce: Add in cooked chicken pieces and rendered juices from baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Heat a few minutes longer: Cover and warm through for a few minutes then serve warm over rice or with naan if desired.</li>

            <summary >Vegetarian Biryani</summary>
            <h4 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: x-large;">Steps:</h4>
            <p> 
                <ol>
                <li>First soak 2 cups rice in 4 cups water for 30 mins and then cook till its Â¾th done. You can cook in a pan, pressure cooker, microwave or in a rice cooker.</li>
                <li>Whilst the rice is cooking, you can prep the veggies and keep them aside. Then heat 4 to 5 tbsp oil and add Â½ cup sliced onions. Fry till the onions become light brown.</li>
                <li>Now add Â¼ or Â½ cup chopped cashews, Â¼ cup raisins, 2 sprig curry leaves and fry till the whole mixture becomes golden brown. Make sure you donâ€™t burn the mixture. Fry on a low flame. By the time onions turn golden browned, the cashews, raisins and curry leaves would have also turned browned. In case you canâ€™t do this way, then fry all of them one by one.</li>
                <li>Keep this fried mixture aside.</li>

                <p> Vegetable Gravy For Kerala Biryani</p>

                <li>Use the same oil in which we fried the onions etc. Take about 2 to 3 tbsp of this oil in a pan. Add the whole spices â€“ 2 inch cinnamon stick, 7-8 cloves and 4-5 green cardamoms. Fry till the oil becomes fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining sliced onions and fry till they are lightly golden.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste and 2 green chilies and fry for a minute.</li>
                <li>Add the dry spice powders: 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp fennel powder, Â½ tsp black pepper powder, Â¼ or Â½ tsp red chilli powder and Â¼ or Â½ tsp turmeric powder. Fry for some seconds.</li>
                <li>Add 2 cups chopped vegetables and stir. Saute for a minute.</li>
                <li>Now add 2 cups coconut milk.</li>
                <li>Stir and then add Â½ cup water along with Â½ or 1 tbsp lemon juice (or Â¼ cup yogurt). If using yogurt, then add at this stage. stir well and add salt. Cover the pan and let the veggies cook. The curry would reduce a bit once the veggies are cooked.</li>
                <li> Add the fried onions, cashews, raisins and curry leaves to the cooked rice.</li>
                <li> Once the vegetables are cooked we can start layering the biryani. The curry has cooked now.</li>

                <p>Layering and making Kerala biryani</p>

                <li> Grease an oven proof pyrex bowl or pan with oil. Layer the vegetable gravy first. Then layer the rice.</li> 
                <li> Spread the chopped mint & coriander leaves on top. Sprinkle the saffron water. Dot with some oil or ghee.</li> 
                <li> Spread another layer of the veg gravy. Now spread the fourth layer of rice. sprinkle the chopped mint & coriander leaves and saffron water. Dot with some oil again. Cover with an aluminium foil.</li> 
                <li> Bake the Kerala biryani in a preheated oven for 200 degrees C at 25-30 mins. The below pic shows biryani after the baking. I prefer to bake biryani rather than dum cook on stovetop as I donâ€™t have to worry about the base layer getting burnt ðŸ™‚</li> 
                <li> Serve the Kerala biryani with raita. I served with veg raita made from soy yogurt.</li>

            <summary >Kerala Style Fishcurry</summary>
            <h4 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: x-large;">Steps:</h4>
            <p> 
                <ol>
                  <li>Clean and cut the fish. Apply some turmeric and keep aside.</li>
                  <li>Grind the coconut with the ingredients under â€˜ To grindâ€™.</li>  
                  <li>In a deep pan, add oil.</li>
                  <li>When the oil is hot add mustard seeds and methi seeds. When the mustard seeds crackle, add shallots and garlic.</li>
                  <li>Once the shallots saute till golden,add tomatoes and spice powders.</li>
                  <li>Cook till the tomatoes becomes mushy.</li>

            <summary>Appam with Stew</summary>
            <h4 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: x-large;">Steps:</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak 2 cups regular rice and 1 cup parboiled rice in water for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
                    <li>Drain and then add them to the grinder. Also add 1 to 1.5 cups grated coconut, a fistful of cooked rice or poha (flattened rice), Â½ teaspoon dry active yeast, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar.

                        You can also proof the yeast separately and then add (check recipe notes below in the recipe card). Since I was grinding in a mixer-grinder, the jar gets warmed up while grinding and thus I added yeast at this stage. Thus helping in leavening of the batter.</li>
                    <li>Add the required amount of water and grind all the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Grind to a smooth flowing batter.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter in a large bowl or pan. Cover and keep aside for fermenting for 8 to 11 hours, depending on the temperature conditions. I kept for almost 12 hours. The batter will rise and double up the next day.</li>
                    <li>This is how a well-fermented batter appears.</li>
                    <li>Heat a kadai with handles or an appam pan. Smear some oil on the kadai. If using nonstick kadai, then skip smearing the oil. Here I have used a kadai to make the appam.

                        The appam pan or appachatti works best as you get soft fluffy texture in the center and crisp texture towards the circumference. Spread a ladle full of the batter. Turn and tilt the pan in circles so as to spread the batter. You can also drizzle a few drops of oil if you prefer.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pan and let the appam cook till the base becomes nicely light golden.</li>
                    <li>Remove and serve appam hot or warm. Make all the appam with the batter in a similar way.</li>
                    <li>Appam goes very well with vegetable stew and sweetened coconut milk. I served with both of them. It can also be served with veg korma or potato stew.</li>

            <summary>Dry Fruit Milkshake</summary>
            <h4 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: x-large;">Steps:</h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak 3 to 4 dried figs in hot water for 30 minutes or in water at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours or more until they soften. If you have dried figs that are soft, then there is no need to soak them.

                        If the dried figs are chewy and hard, then soak them. You can also soak dates if they are hard. If they are soft, then you donâ€™t need to soak them either.</li>
                    <li> Add all of the remaining nuts and dry fruits listed below to a bowl or strainer except the saffron.

                        Â¼ cup almonds
                        Â¼ cup cashews
                        Â¼ cup raisins
                        Â¼ cup pistachios (shelled and unsalted)
                        7 to 8 dates</li>
                    <li>Optional step is to rinse them. I always rinse the nuts, dry fruits before using them in any recipe.</li>
                    <li>Once the figs have softened roughly chop them. Then, roughly chop the dates and discard the seeds if any.</li>
                    <li>Add the rinsed nuts, raisins, chopped figs and dates in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Add Â½ cup chilled milk. I have used soy milk. You can choose to include coconut milk, oats milk, almond milk or dairy milk.</li>
                    <li> Add a pinch of saffron. Saffron gives a beautiful delicate aroma. But if you do not have it, simply skip it.

                        A few options for flavoring and to get a lovely aroma are to add Â½ teaspoon ground cardamom or Â¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon or a pinch of grated/ground nutmeg.</li>
                    <li>Blend to a semi-fine paste. You can make a fine paste if you prefer. If making for small kids, then make a very fine paste.</li>
                    <li>Add the remaining 2 cups of milk. You can also add sugar if you like â€“ about 1 to 2 tablespoons of raw sugar. In place of raw sugar, you can opt for coconut sugar or palm sugar.</li>
                    <li>Blend again well.</li>
                    <li>Pour the dry fruits milkshake into glasses and serve straightway. You can add some sliced nuts like almond or pistachios or a couple of saffron strands for garnishing if you like.</li>
                    <li>Store any leftovers in the refrigerate for a few hours, but try to drink the milkshake the same day.</li>

            <summary>Paneer Tikka</summary>
            <h4 style="font-style: oblique;font-size: x-large;">Steps:</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
              
                <li>Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need Â½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Keep aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.Peel, rinse and dice 1 medium-sized onion in square shaped 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. Rinse and slice 1 small to medium sized capsicum (green bell pepper) in 1 to 1.5 inches pieces. You will need Â½ cup each of onions and capsicum. Keep aside. You can also use tomatoes if you want.</li>
                <li>Crush 1.5 inches ginger and 6 to 7 small to medium sized garlic to a fine paste in a mortar-pestle. You will need 1 tablespoon of crushed ginger-garlic or 1 tablespoon of ready ginger-garlic paste.</li>
                <li>Slice 200 to 250 grams block or paneer into cubes or squares and keep aside. Best is to use homemade paneer.</li>
                <p>Making Hung Curd Marination</p>
                <li>Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till smooth.</li>
                <li>. Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the curd. Also add all the dry spice powders. Below you see the following Indian spice powders in clockwise order:

                    2 teaspoons kashmiri red chili powder
                    1 teaspoon coriander powder
                    Â½ teaspoon turmeric powder
                    Â½ teaspoon garam masala powder
                    1 teaspoon cumin powder
                    1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur)
                    1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
                    1 teaspoon chaat masala
                    Â½ teaspoon black pepper powder (optional)
                    Kashmiri red chili powder gives a nice red color to the food but is not spicy and hot. Instead of kashmiri red chilli powder, you can add 2 teaspoons of sweet paprika or Â½ to 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.</li>
                <li>Add Â½ teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste. If you do not have black salt, then skip it.</li>
                <li>Add Â½ tablespoon (1.5 teaspoons) lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Next add 1 tablespoon mustard oil. If you do not have mustard oil, then use a neutral tasting oil.</li>
                <li>Mix very well. Check the taste and add more seasonings if required.</li>
                
                <p>Marinating Paneer and Veggies</p>
                
                <li> Add the onions, capsicum and paneer to the marinade.</li>
                <li> Slowly and gently mix them with the marinade. Cover and keep the marinated paneer and veggies in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more.</li>
                <li>This is how they look after 2 hours.</li>
                
                <p>Threading Paneer and Veggies</p>

                <li>Begin to thread the veggies and paneer alternately on bamboo skewers. Before you begin to thread preheat oven at 230 or 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degree Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes. Use only the top heating element while preheating as well as grilling. Soak or rinse the bamboo skewers before threading.</li>
                <li>Place them on a tray lined with aluminium foil or parchment paper.</li>
                <li> Brush with some oil all over.</li>

                <p>Making Grilled Paneer Tikka</p>

                <li> Place the tray on the top rack and grill in the preheated oven for 7 to 10 minutes first at 230 to 240 degrees Celsius or 464 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>Then remove the tray from the oven and turn the paneer tikka skewers.</li>
                <li> Again keep back on the top rack in the oven and continue to grill till the edges of paneer and veggies are golden or slightly charred for about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not grill for a long time as then paneer becomes hard. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven do keep a check. You can reduce or increase the time as required. Total grilling time will be 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove once done. Serve the paneer tikka sprinkled with some chaat masala and lemon juice. Also serve mint chutney, onion slices and lemon wedges as sides.</li>
